</p>

---

## Features

## Prerequisites

- Home Assistant 2024.1.0 or newer
- RS485 to TCP gateway (configured and connected to your network)
- Dooya curtain motor with RS485 support

## Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=shubham030&repository=dooya-rs485&category=integration)

1. Click the button above, or:
   - Open HACS in Home Assistant
   - Click on "Integrations"
   - Click the "+" button
   - Search for "Dooya RS485"
   - Click "Download"

2. Restart Home Assistant

3. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **Add Integration** → Search for "Dooya RS485"

### Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/shubham030/dooya-rs485/releases)
2. Extract the `custom_components/dooya_rs485` folder to your Home Assistant's `custom_components` directory
3. Restart Home Assistant
4. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **Add Integration** → Search for "Dooya RS485"

## Configuration

1. Go to Home Assistant **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
2. Click **Add Integration**
3. Search for "Dooya RS485"
4. Fill in the required information:

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Name** | A friendly name for your curtain | Living Room Curtain |
| **TCP Address** | IP address of your RS485 gateway | 192.168.1.100 |
| **TCP Port** | Port number of your RS485 gateway | 502 |
| **Device ID Low** | Low byte of the device address (0-255 or hex) | 0x02 |
| **Device ID High** | High byte of the device address (0-255 or hex) | 0xFE |

## Device Address Programming

The integration supports programming new device addresses. This is useful when you need to change the default factory address (0xFEFE) or assign unique addresses to multiple devices.

### Steps to Program a New Address

1. Press and hold the motor setting button for **5 seconds** until the LED flashes twice
2. Within **10 seconds**, call the `dooya_rs485.program_address` service:

```yaml
service: dooya_rs485.program_address
target:
  entity_id: cover.your_cover_name
data:
  address_low: 18   # New low byte (1-254)
  address_high: 52  # New high byte (1-254)
```

**Important Notes:**
- Address bytes cannot be `0x00` or `0xFF`
- Default factory address is `0xFEFE`
- LED will flash 5 times to confirm successful programming
- If programming fails, the device keeps its previous address

## Services

### `dooya_rs485.program_address`

Program a new device address.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `address_low` | int | Yes | Low byte of new address (1-254) |
| `address_high` | int | Yes | High byte of new address (1-254) |

### Standard Cover Services

All standard Home Assistant cover services are supported:

- `cover.open_cover` - Open the curtain fully
- `cover.close_cover` - Close the curtain fully
- `cover.stop_cover` - Stop the curtain at its current position
- `cover.set_cover_position` - Move the curtain to a specific position (0-100)

## Attributes

The integration exposes several attributes for monitoring device status:

| Attribute | Description | Values |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| `current_position` | Current position | 0-100% |
| `motor_status` | Motor status | stopped / running / error |
| `active_switch_status` | Active switch status | normal / triggered |
| `passive_switch_status` | Passive switch status | normal / triggered |
| `handle_status` | Handle operation status | normal / operated |

## Auto-Recovery

The integration includes automatic recovery features:

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| **Connection fails on startup** | Home Assistant retries automatically (30s, 60s, 120s...) |
| **Gateway not ready after reboot** | Keeps retrying until connection succeeds |
| **Connection lost while running** | Auto-reconnects on next poll cycle |
| **Multiple consecutive failures** | Logs warnings, continues trying |

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

- ✅ Verify TCP gateway IP address and port
- ✅ Check physical RS485 connections (A/B wiring)
- ✅ Ensure correct device address is configured
- ✅ Check that no other application is using the TCP port

### Position Shows "Unknown" or 0xFF

This usually means the motor's stroke (travel limits) hasn't been set:

1. Use the test script or Home Assistant to fully **open** the curtain
2. Then fully **close** the curtain
3. The stroke should now be calibrated and position will report 0-100%

### Communication Errors

- The integration automatically retries failed commands (up to 3 times)
- Connection will be automatically re-established if lost
- Check logs: **Settings** → **System** → **Logs**

### Address Programming Fails

- Ensure button is held until LED flashes **twice**
- Program address within **10 seconds** of LED signal
- Verify new address bytes are not `0x00` or `0xFF`

## Debug Logging

To enable debug logging, add this to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.dooya_rs485: debug
```

## Test Scripts

The repository includes standalone Python scripts for debugging and testing your setup outside of Home Assistant.

### test_connection.py

Tests the connection and reads device status (READ-ONLY, safe).

```bash
# Test with default address (0xFEFE)
python test_connection.py

# Test with custom address
python test_connection.py 0x02 0xFE
```

### test_set_stroke.py

Controls the curtain and monitors position in real-time.

```bash
# Open the curtain
python test_set_stroke.py open

# Close the curtain
python test_set_stroke.py close

# Stop immediately
python test_set_stroke.py stop

# Monitor position only (no movement)
python test_set_stroke.py monitor
```

### test_program_address.py

Programs a new RS485 address on a device. ⚠️ **This changes the device permanently!**

```bash
# Program address to 0xFE02
python test_program_address.py 0x02 0xFE

# Program address to 0x1234
python test_program_address.py 0x34 0x12
```

**Steps:**
1. Press and hold motor button for 5 seconds until LED flashes **twice**
2. Run the script within 10 seconds
3. LED flashes 5 times = success

**Note:** Edit the configuration section in each script to match your setup (IP, port, device ID).

## Home Assistant Scripts & Automations

See the `examples/` folder for ready-to-use Home Assistant configurations:

- **`ha_scripts.yaml`** - Scripts for controlling curtains and programming addresses
- **`shell_commands.yaml`** - Shell commands to run test scripts from HA

### Example: Program Address from HA UI

Add to your `scripts.yaml`:

```yaml
program_dooya_address:
  alias: "Program Dooya Address"
  sequence:
    - service: dooya_rs485.program_address
      target:
        entity_id: cover.my_curtain
      data:
        address_low: 2    # 0x02
        address_high: 254 # 0xFE
```

### Example: Close Curtains at Sunset

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Close Curtains at Sunset"
    trigger:
      - platform: sun
        event: sunset
        offset: "+00:30:00"
    action:
      - service: cover.close_cover
        target:
          entity_id: cover.living_room_curtain
```

## Protocol Details

The integration uses the Dooya RS485 protocol:

| Read Command | `0x01` |
| Write Command | `0x02` |
| Control Command | `0x03` |
| Address Programming | `0x04` |
| CRC | CRC16 Modbus (little-endian) |
| Default Address | `0xFEFE` |

### Response Format (8 bytes)

```

[1] Device ID Low
[2] Device ID High
[3] Function Code
[4] Echo/Status
[5] Data Value  ← Position is here
